Vanilla JS - runs in the browser(within the web browser such as chrome, firefox) - which is known as Client-side JS. Its used in making webpages interactive. 

Node JS - it runs on the server-side, which execute the javascript code outside the browser. 

both NodeJS and Vanilla JS uses module - ES6. 

Definition of Node JS: Node JS is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser.

Purpose of NodeJS: 
1. Helps us build server-side applications using JavaScript
2. Handle asynchronous operations well.

Differences between client side js and server side js:
1. client side js runs in the browser to manage user interface interactions and server side js runs on a server to handle backend logic, database interactions, and API requests
2. Client side js code is visible to user, server side js code is hidden and secure
3. Server side provides more security to js files and any private information

zomato.com made a deal with SBI, allowing zomato to access SBI net banking for payments. SBI gave the access to zomato to use its net banking service, and SBI gave a secret password for zomato to access. Should zomato write the code to access SBI networking on client side or server side?

- zomato.com will preserve its keys within the server side code such that they are not exposed to the oustide world.

Why Node JS? Why not any other language for writing server?
1. Developer experience: Once you learn js, you can create both client and server in the same language.
2. Fast and Scalable: its built on v8 javascript engine (optional)
3. Node JS can handle multiple requests efficiently (event loop)

Question 1: Create a server which runs on port 4123 of your local machine and keeps adding 2 to a number set to a default value of 0, everytime you reload the page (everytime you make a request to the server).
