### Conceptual Problems (5 Questions)

#### **Question 1:**
What is a server? Explain its purpose and how it interacts with a client in a web application.

**Answer:**
A server is a computer that stores websites, files, and other resources, providing them to other computers, called clients, when requested.

In a web application:

Client request: The client uses a web browser to request a website by entering its URL or clicking a link.

Server response: The server receives your request, processes it, and sends back the requested webpage or data.

Display: The browser displays the website on your screen.

#### **Question 2:**
What is a port in the context of a server? Why do we specify ports like 3000 or 8080 when creating a server?

**Answer:**
A port is a communication endpoint on a server, like a door to a specific room in a house. Each service on the server uses a different port to direct network traffic correctly.

Specifying Ports
When setting up a server, you choose a port (e.g., 3000 or 8080) to determine where it listens for incoming requests. Different ports prevent services from interfering with each other:

Port 80: Default for regular web traffic (HTTP).

Port 443: For secure web traffic (HTTPS).

Ports 3000/8080: Often used by developers for testing or running web applications locally.

#### **Question 3:**
What is a library in Node.js? How does it help developers? Provide an example of a library in Node.js.

**Answer:**
A library in Node.js is a collection of reusable code that helps developers simplify tasks and speed up development by providing pre-built functions and features.

Benefits:
Code Reuse: Use existing functions for common tasks like handling files, databases, or requests.
Efficiency: Focus on building core functionality while the library handles complex operations.

#### **Question 4:**
Explain the purpose of the `http` module in Node.js. How is it different from other libraries like `fs`?

**Answer:**

The HTTP module in Node.js is used to create and manage web servers, handling HTTP requests and responses. It enables developers to build web applications, APIs, or any service communicating over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Purpose:
•	Create web servers: Set up servers to receive requests and send responses.
•	Handle HTTP requests: Manage incoming requests and define server responses.
•	Send responses: Serve content and process data when clients interact with the server.
Difference from fs Module:
•	http: For networking and web-related tasks.
•	fs(File system): For file operations on the server (reading, writing, deleting files).


#### **Question 5:**
What is the difference between exporting and importing in Node.js? Provide an example of how to export and import a module.

**Answer:**
In Node.js, exporting and importing allow sharing code between files or modules.

Exporting: Makes variables, functions, or objects available to other files.
Importing: Brings in exported values from one file to another for use.

Difference:
Exporting: Defines what a module shares with others.
Importing: Allows using the shared features from another module.

### Coding Problems (5 Questions)

#### **Question 6:**
Write a Node.js script to create a simple server using the `http` module that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed on port 3000.

**Answer:**

#### **Question 7:**
Modify the server from the previous question to respond with "Welcome to my server!" when accessed at `/welcome` and "Page not found" for other routes.

**Answer:**

#### **Question 8:**
Create a module named `greet.js` that exports a function to greet a user by name. Import the module into another script and use it to greet a user.

**Answer:**

#### **Question 9:**
Write a script to log the details of every request made to your server (e.g., request method and URL).

**Answer:**

#### **Question 10:**
Use the `http` module to create a server that returns JSON data for a route `/data`. The JSON should include a simple object like:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, this is JSON!",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Answer:**
